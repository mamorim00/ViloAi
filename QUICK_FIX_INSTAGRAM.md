# Quick Fix for "Invalid App ID" Error

## What Was Wrong

The app was trying to use **Facebook OAuth** instead of **Instagram Basic Display API**.

## What I Fixed

âœ… **Updated OAuth flow** to use Instagram's API endpoints
âœ… **Fixed token exchange** to use correct Instagram endpoints
âœ… **Updated user data fetching** to use Instagram Graph API
âœ… **Added environment validation** to catch config issues early
âœ… **Created detailed setup guide** (see META_APP_SETUP.md)
