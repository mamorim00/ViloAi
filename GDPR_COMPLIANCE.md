## 2. Legal Basis for Processing

GDPR requires a legal basis for all data processing. ViloAi uses the following legal grounds:

### 2.1 Contract Performance (GDPR Article 6(1)(b))

**Applies to**: Core service functionality

We process data necessary to deliver our Instagram DM management service:
- User account data (email, name)
- Instagram connection data (access tokens, user ID)
- Instagram messages and comments
- AI analysis of messages
- Subscription and billing data

**Justification**: Without processing this data, we cannot provide the service the user signed up for.

### 2.2 Legitimate Interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(f))

**Applies to**: Service improvement, security, fraud prevention

We process data where we have a legitimate business interest that doesn't override user privacy:
- Analytics to improve platform features
- Security logs to prevent abuse
- Performance monitoring to ensure uptime
- Aggregated, anonymized usage statistics

**Balancing Test**: We ensure our interests don't override users' rights through:
- Minimal data collection
- Strong security measures
- Transparency about processing
- Easy opt-out mechanisms

### 2.3 Consent (GDPR Article 6(1)(a))

**Applies to**: Optional features

We obtain explicit consent for:
- **Analytics cookies**: Users can accept or reject via cookie banner
- **Marketing emails**: Opt-in only (if we add this feature)
- **AI training**: We anonymize data before using it to improve AI models

**Consent Requirements Met**:
- ✅ Freely given (users can refuse without consequences)
- ✅ Specific (separate consent for different purposes)
- ✅ Informed (clear explanations in Privacy Policy)
- ✅ Unambiguous (clear affirmative action required)
- ✅ Withdrawable (users can change cookie preferences anytime)

### 2.4 Legal Obligation (GDPR Article 6(1)(c))

**Applies to**: Compliance with laws

We retain certain data to comply with:
- Finnish tax laws (invoice records for 7 years)
- Accounting regulations
- Anti-money laundering requirements
