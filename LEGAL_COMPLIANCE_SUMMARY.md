**Why**: ViloAi does not engage in:
- Large-scale systematic monitoring

- Automated decision-making with legal effects

**Note**: If you add features like automated credit scoring or large-scale profiling, a DPIA may be required.

**Current Status**: Not required

**Why**: GDPR requires a DPO only if you:
- Are a public authority, OR
