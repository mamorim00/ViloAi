## Critical Production Issues to Watch

### Issue 1: Localhost Redirects
**Symptom:** After Stripe checkout, redirects to `localhost:3000`
**Cause:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` not updated
**Fix:** Update env var to production URL and redeploy

### Issue 2: Subscription Not Updating
**Symptom:** Payment succeeds but tier stays "free"
**Cause:** Stripe Price IDs don't match database
**Fix:** Update subscription_plans table with LIVE Price IDs

### Issue 3: Multiple Active Subscriptions
**Symptom:** User has 3+ active subscriptions
**Cause:** Creating new subscription without canceling old one
**Fix:** Implement upgrade flow that cancels old subscription (see below)

### Issue 4: Instagram OAuth Fails
**Symptom:** "Not admin of any pages"
**Cause:** Missing permissions or wrong redirect URI
**Fix:** Add all scopes + update Meta app settings

### Issue 5: Messages Not Syncing
**Symptom:** No messages appear after sync
**Cause:** Instagram token expired or invalid
**Fix:** Reconnect Instagram account
